3.	The variance of a single principal component is calculated by performing SVD on the (image)data matrix after substracting the mean. This gives us the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and, by squaring the singluar values s and dividing them by N (number of faces), we get the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. These eigenvalues descibes the marginal variance captured by the eigenvectors, so we can compute the variance of a single principal component by computing those eigenvalues.
