7.  They are both the same image so there is no difference. This Image carries
    the base information of the original Image, meaning base Brightness. Each
    Iteration of the reconstruction adds more detail to the Image.

8.  We ended up at scaling both layers by two which resulted in a pleasing result
    optically. When the first layer is scaled too much, the noise get amplified a
    lot resulting in a grainy image. When we turn up the second layer to much,
    the image gets blurry because we amplify more lower frequency changes.
    To make the effect more visible we also looked at the Image 2*im-im_rec,
    which should result in a blurry image if im_rec is sharper than im. Because
    im_sharp = (im-im_blur)+im. In our case im_sharp is im_rec an we want to look
    at im_blur. Also perceived sharpness not only depends on the actual line width,
    but also in contrast an overall brightness. So to visually compare the two
    images they should be brought the the same overall brightness and contrast.
