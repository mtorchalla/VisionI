By reducing the number of clusters, we cluster together feature vector groups with different meaning into one cluster. This means the cluster center will move to the middle of these groups and we will classify every feature from all the feature groups into this one cluster. This can result the mixed clusters of features of both Classes, Bikes and Airplanes. This problem can be seen in the 2D Plot of the Histogram PCA, where all points will lie in one inseparable cloud. But when the Cluster number is chosen high enough the point clouds start to separate and the can see the vector regions for each Class.
